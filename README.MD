The provided code is an implementation of a scheduler that distributes resources fairly among individual tasks based on their project membership. The scheduler is designed to run continuously and has a constant number of N resources available. The scheduler assigns tasks to resources, and each resource can execute one task at a time and is fully occupied until the task is completed. The scheduler balances the computational resources among all projects equally, and can retrieve the current state of a resource (i.e. if it is free or busy). The scheduler also provides output to the console/log informing which task has started and which ended, as well as any additional useful information.

You can adjust the number of resources by changing the range of the list comprehension in the first line of the __main__ block. The scheduler will run continuously and will keep getting tasks from the outside interface and assigning them to resources as they become available.
